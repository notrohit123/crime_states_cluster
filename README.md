INDIAN STATES CRIME RATE 2019 CLUSTERS:

ABSTRACT: Crimes has been prevalent in our societies for a long time and it continues even today albeit so much law enforcement.It is suprising to know that 
an increased number of cops has nothing to do with less number of crimes.

AIMS AND OBJECTIVE:

* To review existing literature on crime rate of states in india
* To cluster the states based on the crime rates

DATASETS COLLECTED:

* population
* literacy rate
* Murders
* Rapes
* Robbery
* Assault
* Property Crime 
* Burglary 
* Larceny theft 
* Vehicle theft

ANAMOLIES:
* outliers produced are anomalies as some crimes in a states exceeds other crimes in the same state.

NOTE:
* Before removing the literacy rate feature i have to mention that the reason why i took literacy rate as a feature was states with high literacy has high crime report, which is really appreciated. the people trust the police system and there is awareness and a good justice atmosphere. while states with low crime rate tends to be less at crime reporting as there isn't any awareness about reporting the crimes.
